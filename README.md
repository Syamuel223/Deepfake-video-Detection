DEEPFAKE VIDEO DETECTION SYSTEM
Jan 2025 - May 2025Jan 2025 - May 2025

Technologies used: Python, Streamlit, TensorFlow, OpenCV, Scikit-learn, Machine Learning, DFD (Deep Fake Detection) Dataset
1. Built a deepfake video detection web application using Streamlit with real-time prediction capabilities.
2.Trained a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) on the Deep Fake Detection (DFD) Entire Original Dataset to classify manipulated video frames.
3.Employed OpenCV for face detection and frame extraction, feeding cropped facial regions into the model for robust prediction.
4.Achieved ~93% accuracy in distinguishing real vs. fake video content on validation data.
5.Developed a user-friendly interface for uploading videos and visualizing prediction confidence scores with clear
feedback.
